<br>
<p>A small collection of cogs for Red Discord Bot. Mostly for entertainment but maybe also for other fun things in future.</p>
<br>

<p>To my repository to your bot, make sure you first have Downloader cog loaded! To do this do:

**NOTE:** Replace [p] with your own prefix!

```
[p]load Downloader
```

Then proceed to adding my repo with
```
[p]repo add plofts-cogs https://github.com/plofts/v3-cogs
```

To install the cog you need

```
[p]cog install plofts-cogs <cog name>
```
</p>
